git clone REPOSITORY_URL
git config --global config.ui auto
git checkout ID (restores all files to state at commit)

HEAD is the commit you are currently working on and you've detached from it because you checkout another commit

lconsidine ~ $ git config --global core.editor "'C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad
++\notepad++.exe' -n -w"

lconsidine ~ $ git config --global push.default upstream
lconsidine ~ $ git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

That is because git diff considers the first argument as the "original", and the second argument as the "new" version, so additions are lines present in the second argument but not the first.

git init
git status
git add file_name.ext
git status


git add
git status
git commit

git diff (with no arguments)
shows the difference between working directory and the staging area

git diff --staged
shows changes between last commit and staging area

git reset --hard

git branch (shows branch)
git branch _name_new_branch_
git checkout _check_out_branch_
